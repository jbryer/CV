I strongly believe that a diversity in students, faculty, and researchers is critical for a successful institution. As a researcher specializing in statistics and methodology with a mathematics undergraduate degree, I am especially sensitive to the lack of diversity in the mathematics and statistics fields. I have engaged in several conferences and workshops including two *Creating Balance in an Unjust World* (http://creatingbalanceconference.org/) conferences held in New York. These conferences were inspirational and informative in thinking about the impact of that the lack of diversity in math has, but also ways to address these issues vis-Ã -vis the teaching of social just issues through a mathematics lens. I have also become a subscriber and supporter of the *Rethinking Schools* (http://www.rethinkingschools.org) organization and publication.

Currently, I am employed at Excelsior College, a post-traditional college a mission to serve underrepresented students. I am proud of the work I have done to help non-traditional students (e.g. adults, first generation, minority, and military students) achieve a college degree. The research I have done at Excelsior College has directly impacted programs and interventions designed to help student succeed. I believe education is the greatest tool for social mobility and believe that everyone should have an opportunity to take advantage of this tool for learning.
