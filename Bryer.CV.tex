\section{Dissertation}
\cvline{Title}{\textit{A National Study Comparing Charter and Traditional Public Schools Using Propensity Score Analysis}}
\cvline{Committee}{Robert M. Pruzek (chair), Bruce Dudek, Kathryn S. Schiller}
\cvline{Abstract}{\small The use of propensity score analysis (Rosenbaum \& Rubin, 1983) has gained increasing popularity for the estimation of causal effects within observational studies. However, its use in situations where data is multilevel, or clustered, is limited (Arpino \& Mealli, 2008; Thommes \& West, 2011). This study will introduce the multilevelPSA (Bryer, 2011) package for R that provides functions for estimating propensity scores for large datasets using logistic regression and conditional inference trees. Furthermore, a set of graphical functions that extends the framework of visualizing propensity score analysis introduced by Helmreich and Pruzek (2009) to multilevel analysis will be discussed. An application for estimating the effects of charter schools as compared to traditional public schools on reading and mathematics in grades 4 and 8 is provided.}

\section{Teaching Experiences}
\cvline{Fall 2013}{EPSY 530 Statistics I (University at Albany)\newline \small Descriptive statistics including measures of central tendency and variability, correlation and regression. Introduction to statistical inference, including sampling distributions, significance tests, confidence intervals, and power of tests of significance.
\newline Course website: \url{http://epsy530.bryer.org}}
\cvline{Spring 2013}{EPSY 887 Institute in Education: Computational Statistics (University at Albany)\newline \small This seminar will provide an introduction to statistical programming for data analysis with an emphasis on the analysis of large datasets. With the increased availability of large national and international datasets (e.g. PISA, TIMMS, NAEP, ECLS) there is a great opportunity and potential for researchers to address important questions. However, the analysis of large datasets requires special analytical procedures not found in commercial statistics software. Utilizing the open source statistical software R, students will be introduced to the tools and procedures for analyzing large datasets with an emphasis on conducting transparent and reproducible research. 
\newline Course website: \url{https://github.com/jbryer/CompStats}}
